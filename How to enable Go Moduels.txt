after installing Go
open CMD
type:
go version 
This makes sure its installed
goto repo "Note the path if go is installed on C drive will be C\User\go\bin"
cd 'Drive:\RepoFolder\FolderPath
make a file here as a .go "you dont have to do it in cmd or shell"
Example
golang```
package main

import "fmt" <- formated io

func main() {
 fmt.Println("Hello from go")
}



```
IMPORTANT
in command promt do

cd .\goscriptfolder\ <- go where the script is at change dir to it so your on its position obvoiusly
type:

go mod init name  @name is the name of the moduel your making. name it whatever the script is called
it will say after:

go: creating new go.mod: module name

go: to add module requirements and sums:
go mod tidy


you will build with Cmake later in Windows PowerShell AFTER YOUR CMAKELIST IS MADE and VS STUDIO 2026 IS SETUP here like this for cpp and c scripts 
EXAMPLE

"'E:\cmake\bin\cmake.exe' --build " <- Location where cmake.exe is located. COULD BE ANYWHERE YOU PUT IT LIKE IF YOU INSTALLED CMAKE ON C DRIVE 
"'G:\Repos2\UsingLLVM\build\EngineClean' --config Release" <- configured output file

Full buildcommand

& 'C:\cmake\bin\cmake.exe' --build 'E:\Repos\HTTPParserProject\build\ParserProgram' --config Release
could also do build full and other additives

Simple How-To: Go + CMake (Windows)
Go setup (quick check)

After installing Go:

Open Command Prompt

Type:

go version


If it prints a version, Go is installed correctly.

Note:
If Go was installed on the C drive, the default path is usually:
C:\Users\<YourUser>\go\bin

Create a Go file

Go to your repo folder

cd Drive:\RepoFolder\FolderPath


Create a .go file (you do not need to do this in CMD)

Example main.go:

package main

import "fmt" // formatted IO

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go")
}

Initialize Go module (IMPORTANT)

In Command Prompt, change directory to where the Go file is:

cd .\goscriptfolder\


Initialize the module:

go mod init name


name can be anything — usually the project or script name.

You should see:

go: creating new go.mod: module name


Clean up dependencies:

go mod tidy


At this point, your Go side is ready.

CMake + C++ build steps (Windows)

These steps assume:

Visual Studio 2026 is installed

CMake is installed (any location is fine)

You are building a C++ project (for example, your HTTP parser)

Folder layout (recommended)
HTTPParserProject/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── src/
│   └── main.cpp
└── build/

Example CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.26)
project(HTTPParser LANGUAGES CXX)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 20)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)

add_executable(ParserProgram
    src/main.cpp
)

Configure the build (FIRST STEP)

Open Windows PowerShell (recommended over CMD):

cd E:\Repos\HTTPParserProject


Run CMake configure:

& 'C:\cmake\bin\cmake.exe' -S . -B build


What this does:

-S . → source directory (where CMakeLists.txt is)

-B build → output build folder

Detects Visual Studio automatically

Build the project (SECOND STEP)

After configuration succeeds:

& 'C:\cmake\bin\cmake.exe' --build 'E:\Repos\HTTPParserProject\build' --config Release


Explanation:

--build → tells CMake to compile

--config Release → Release build (use Debug if needed)

Output location

Your compiled .exe will be located at:

build\Release\ParserProgram.exe

Notes / Tips

CMake can be installed anywhere (C drive, E drive, etc.)

Always configure first, then build

If you change CMakeLists.txt, re-run the configure command

You can also open the generated .sln in Visual Studio if you want IDE debugging



VISUAL STUDIO STUFF

Visual Studio 2026 (Latest) — Prerequisites & Setup (Windows)

⚠️ Important

Visual Studio ≠ VS Code

CMake uses Visual Studio (MSVC toolchain), not VS Code

VS Code is optional and does not replace Visual Studio

1. Download Visual Studio (Latest)

Go to the official site:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/

Download Visual Studio Community (free)

Run the installer

2. REQUIRED Workloads (DO NOT SKIP)

When the installer opens, select:

✅ Desktop development with C++ (MANDATORY)

This installs:

MSVC compiler (cl.exe)

Windows SDK

MSBuild

CMake integration support

3. REQUIRED Individual Components

Click “Individual components” tab and make sure these are checked:

Compilers & Toolchains

✅ MSVC v143 – VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools

✅ C++ CMake tools for Windows

✅ C++ ATL (safe to have, not required but common)

✅ C++ core features

Windows SDK

✅ Windows 10 SDK (10.0.19041+)

OR

✅ Windows 11 SDK (latest available)

You only need one Windows SDK.

4. Optional but Strongly Recommended

These make life easier:

☑ Git for Windows

☑ GitHub integration

☑ AddressSanitizer (C++)

☑ C++ profiling tools

5. Install & Wait

Click Install and let it finish.
This can take a while.

After install:

Restart Windows (recommended)

6. Verify Visual Studio Toolchain

Open x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS

You can find it by typing this into Start:

x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS


Then type:

cl


If you see compiler output (not an error), MSVC is installed correctly.

7. Verify CMake Integration (IMPORTANT)

Visual Studio ships with CMake, but you can also use your own CMake install.

Check Visual Studio’s bundled CMake:

cmake --version


If that works, you’re good.

If not, install standalone CMake:
https://cmake.org/download/

During install:

✔ “Add CMake to system PATH”

8. Visual Studio Version Naming (Important Clarity)

As of now:

Visual Studio 2022 is the current toolchain

Even if marketed later (2025 / 2026 timeframe), it still:

Uses MSVC v143

Uses the VS 17.x generator internally

CMake will report something like:

Visual Studio 17 2022


This is normal and correct, even in 2026.

9. Confirm CMake Can See Visual Studio

From PowerShell:

cmake -G


You should see:

Visual Studio 17 2022


If it appears, CMake can generate builds correctly.

10. (Optional) Using VS Code

VS Code is optional and used only as an editor.

If you do install it:

Install C/C++ extension (ms-vscode.cpptools)

Install CMake Tools extension

⚠️ VS Code does NOT install compilers.

11. Final Checklist

Before building with CMake, you should have:

✅ Visual Studio Community installed

✅ Desktop development with C++

✅ MSVC v143

✅ Windows SDK

✅ CMake available in PATH

✅ cl works

✅ cmake --version works
